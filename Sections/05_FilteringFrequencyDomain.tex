\section{Frequency Domain Filtering}
Applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear Filters: Low-pass, High-pass, Band-pass
    \item Pattern detection (including noise removal)
    \item Image compression
    \item Inverse filtering for image restoration
\end{itemize}
\textbf{DFT for images(2D):}
\[
F(u,v) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{B\cdot H}} \sum_{x=0}^{B-1} \sum_{y=0}^{H-1} f(x,y)
\cdot
e^{-j2\pi\left(\frac{ux}{B} + \frac{vy}{H}\right)}
\]
\[
0 \leq u < B
\quad
0 \leq v < H
\]

Resulting Image in frequency domain has to be centered.

The phase contains important information!
\subsection{Applications of the DFT for images}
\textbf{Convolution Theorem:}
\[
f(x,y) * g(x,y) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{\mathcal{F}\{f(x,y)\} \cdot \mathcal{F}\{g(x,y)\}\right\}
\]
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operations are computationally cheaper in the frequency domain.
    \item All linear operations (high-pass, low-pass and band-pass) achieve high quality results and require less computational operations.
    \item Recognition and manipulation of periodic structures.
\end{itemize}
In order to use the DFT the origin of the kernel and the origin of the image
have to correspond.
